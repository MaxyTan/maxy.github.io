## Loan-to-Deposit Ratio Analysis

This data visualization presents a comparison of the **Loan-to-Deposit (L/D) Ratio** of two major Singapore banks, **DBS** and **OCBC**, across multiple years. The Loan-to-Deposit Ratio is a quantitative financial metric used to measure the proportion of a bank’s total loans relative to its total deposits within the same period.

Typically, the ideal Loan-to-Deposit Ratio for banks lies between **80% and 90%**. This range indicates that the bank has lent out 80% to 90% of its deposited funds. Since money lent out generates interest income, a bank with a very low L/D ratio may not be utilizing its deposits efficiently, which can result in lower earnings.

From the visualization, we can observe that **DBS consistently maintains a higher Loan-to-Deposit Ratio than OCBC** over the years shown. This suggests that DBS is able to generate more interest income, as it lends out a larger proportion of its customer deposits. In contrast, OCBC maintains a slightly lower L/D ratio, indicating a more conservative lending strategy.

This visualization was created as part of a **business analysis project** during my course of study, using **Tableau** as the visualization tool. Tableau was chosen because it allows for interactive exploration of financial data. For example, users can interact with the data points on the chart to view additional information such as the **total deposits of each bank for a specific year**, providing deeper insights beyond the trend lines.

The rationale behind this visualization approach was to clearly communicate trends and comparisons over time using a **line chart**, which is well suited for time-series quantitative data. By visualizing the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio across years, stakeholders can easily assess changes in lending behavior and compare financial performance between the two banks.
