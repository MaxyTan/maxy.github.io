## Final Year Project: Financial Automation

For my Final Year Project in Singapore Polytechnic, I collaborated with a company to streamline their internal financial operations. The primary goal was to eliminate the risks associated with manual data entry and calculation.

### The Challenge
The company relied on manual processes for calculating **Financial Year (FY) figures**, which was not only time-consuming but also prone to human error. These calculations are critical for accurate reporting and compliance, making the manual approach a significant bottleneck.

### The Solution: VBA Automation
I developed a bespoke automation tool using **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)** within Excel to:
* **Automate Complex Calculations:** Built custom scripts to handle multi-stage FY calculations instantly.
* **Ensure Data Integrity:** Implemented validation checks to flag inconsistencies in raw data.
* **Enhance Efficiency:** Reduced the time spent on monthly and yearly closing processes from hours to a few minutes.
